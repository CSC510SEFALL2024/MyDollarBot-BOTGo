# Extract Data and Generate CSV Report

This document provides an overview of the Python script used to extract data and generate a CSV report. This script is designed to be used in a larger project, and its primary purpose is to extract data and create a CSV report based on that data.

## Functions and Methods

### run(message, bot)
This function is the main entry point for data extraction and CSV report generation.

- `message`: The message object received from the user in the chat.
- `bot`: The bot instance used to interact with the Telegram API.

### Main Workflow
1. The user initiates data extraction by calling the `run()` function.
2. The user's chat ID is obtained from the message.
3. The script checks for the existence of a file named "data.csv" in the "code" directory.
4. If the file exists, it is used as a data source.
5. If the file does not exist, the script calls a separate method to extract the required data.
6. The extracted data is then saved as a CSV report.
7. The CSV report is sent to the user as a document.
